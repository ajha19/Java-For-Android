# Java-For-Android
In this MOOC, we'll cover key objectionary features that are supported by the Java programming language. These Java features enhance the clarity of an app by controlling its flow of execution. Enhance app utility by enabling access to structure data. Enhance app modularity by grouping related methods and fields into classes and interfaces that shield apps from implementation details that are likely to change. And enhance app extensibility by transparently customizing the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and polymorphism to meet new requirements.
